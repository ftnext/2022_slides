About "Revisit Python from statements and PEG"
--------------------------------------------------

:audience: Intermediate level (equivalent of those who answered "yes")
:subject: **appearance** pf Python

.. Congrats! you are target audience.
    I will talk about appearance pf Python such as the if line needs a colon.

Audience take away
--------------------------------------------------

* Components of Python statements: *expressions and keywords*
* Explanation of the statement by *clauses, headers, and suites*
* How to read *PEG*

.. You know the Components of Python statements.
    You hear Explanation of the statement from different view point
    We read together the PEG.

Motivation: Python itself is interesting!
--------------------------------------------------

* Language Reference is *difficult*? But exciting!
* Difficulty may comes from confusion between **new** and old grammatical expressions, so resolve it (as first step)

.. Do you consider Python language reference difficult?
    I have tried repeatedly to read the references and find it exciting now that I know a little more!
    Dramatic changes occurred in Python 3.9 silently
    and confusion between **new** and old grammatical expressions may make us feel difficulty.
    As a first step, I will try to resolve the confusion in this talk.
