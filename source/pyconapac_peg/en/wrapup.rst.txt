SummaryðŸŒ¯: Revisit Python from statements and PEG
============================================================

* Focus on appearance of compound statements of Python (**concrete syntax**).
* learn how to read PEG and tasted the syntax of compound sentences.

.. Wrap up!
    I focused on the appearance of compound statements of current Python,
    what is called concrete syntax.
    We learned how to read PEG and tasted the syntax of compound sentences.

.. revealjs-break::

* Compound statements consist of headers and suites
* Colons and indents **tell parser** elements of statements

.. Compound statements consist of headers and suites (The two create clause).
    Colons and indents tell the parser the elements of statements

.. revealjs-break::

* Taste PEG's **concise** expression **without ommissions**
* Language Reference is difficult but exciting!

.. We read PEG together and Taste PEG's **concise** expression **without ommissions**
    One of the message is Language Reference is difficult but exciting!

Thank you very much for your attention.

**Enjoy** development with Python!
