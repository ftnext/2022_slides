``while`` statement
========================================

    The while statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true:

`8.2. The while statement <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement>`_

.. The while statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true

Syntax of ``while`` statement
------------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: grammar/while.gram
    :language: peg

.. The syntax of the while statement is defined by just these two lines

Taste ``while`` statement
------------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: grammar/while.gram
    :language: peg

* **Required**: Clause with a header starting with the keyword ``while`` and following block
* Optional ``else_block``

.. A clause consisting of a header starting with the keyword while and the following block is required
    The else_block seen in if statement comes optionally.

``while`` ``else``
------------------------------------------------

    if the expression is false (which may be the first time it is tested) the suite of the else clause, if present, is executed and the loop terminates.

    A break statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the else clauseâ€™s suite.

.. About while else,
    if the expression is false, the suite of the else clause is executed and the loop terminates.
    When a break statement executed, the else clauseâ€™s suite is not executed.
    This kind of syntax is defined in Python.


ðŸš¨ Syntax supports, but do not use ``else_block`` in loop (recommend)
